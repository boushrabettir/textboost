The Emancipation Proclamation (1863) - Issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, during the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation declared all enslaved people in Confederate-held territory to be forever free. While it did not immediately free all slaves, it fundamentally changed the war's purpose, making the abolition of slavery a central goal for the Union, and paved the way for the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
