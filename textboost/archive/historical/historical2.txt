The Magna Carta (1215) - The Magna Carta, signed by King John of England in 1215, is a fundamental document that established the principle of the rule of law and curtailed the absolute power of the monarchy. It granted certain rights and liberties to the English barons and freemen, limiting the king's authority and ensuring that even the monarch was subject to the law. The Magna Carta is considered a cornerstone of constitutional governance and influenced the development of modern democratic principles.
