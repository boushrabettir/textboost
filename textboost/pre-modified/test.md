**Why Technology Needs More Female Entrepreneurs**

In 2020 alone, only 25% of women held tech-related job positions in the industry. This

statistic did not come to me as a surprise then, nor does it now. Overtime, one may think that this

statistic might have grown overtime, however, history says otherwise. Throughout history, the

concept of gender inequality and the resulting discrepancies have been apparent. This inturn,

resulted in many problems. Even beyond this, during the time when women were forced to be

housewives while men enjoyed social work freedom, it highlighted an idea of gender inequality.

This societal construct, often referred to as “separate spheres” has been a lingering ideology

influencing U.S. history, and ultimately to the issues we as a society face. Stemming from deeply

ingrained gender norms and expectations as seen throughout history, this construct has created an

imbalance in gender equality for women, shaping their roles in society today.

With several challenges that the tech industry continues to face, it is no surprise that there

is a growing recognition for a more diverse workforce. Aspiring female entrepreneurs like

myself have great potential to hold a critical role in not only the tech industry, but to address

issues that regard gender inequality. Not only that, but by bringing diverse voices to the table, not

only can they create solutions, but also allow other female entrepreneurs to become more

confident in their role. This inturn will bridge the gender gap in the tech industry. Female

representation offers more than simply diversity. Female entrepreneurs offer problem-solving

approaches, which is a heavy need in the tech world. Their diverse, new, and fresh perspectives

can lead to the development of inclusive technologies, and a better experience for users in terms

of their products and services. For instance, the founder of Girls Who Code, Reshma Saujani,

created an organization committed to immerse diversity in tech by creating free summer courses

for high school students. She advocates to stop the gender discrimination that comes into play in

every shape or form in the industry (digitaltrends, Rawes). With this, increasing female

entrepreneurship can create great potential in the industry.

Despite this immense progress, the tech industry still has a significant gender disparity

problem. According to Forbes magazine, in the U.S., 57% of females in 2021 felt burnout at

work to secure their job. On the other side of the spectrum, only 36% of men felt this way.

Reports showed that females naturally work harder and more diligently to prove their hard work,

and to gain promotions. In meetings, men outnumber women, at least by a 2:1 ratio (Forbes,

Green). CIO, a trusted source for business technology news, offered some insightful facts about

this devastating issue. In the U.S., only 28% of women held jobs related to tech where women

identifying as Asian or Pacific Islander made up only 7% of the IT workforce. The other races

such as Black, Hispanic, and so forth, made up only 3% of the workforce (CIO, White).

Additionally, females have trouble holding leadership positions, or even attaining them at all, due

to the barriers that exist such as systemic biases, discrimination, imposter syndrome, and so

much more. Not only that, but limited representation within the work environment they are in

can cause difficulty in decision-making positions. Addressing these issues requires a group

effort, and successfully can combat gender discrimination.

Coming from an immigrant family with only female sisters, I found it both challenging

and empowering to strive for educational achievements beyond what was traditionally expected.

In a society where gender norms and expectations often shape opportunities, being part of a

family where my sisters and I were encouraged to pursue education became a driving force in my

journey. My dad was fascinated with the world that tech had to offer, however, since he

sacrificed his education to bring me a better and fulfilling education, he never could achieve

those dreams and aspirations. It was a delight when he found out I loved technology. Fast

forward to today, where I am fully indulged and fascinated with the tech industry. Specifically,

my current major is Computer Science, but I have been coding and opening the doors to new

tools to use for many years before then. As a computer science female student myself, I have run

into issues regarding this. With limited representation in my community, it is quite difficult to be

taken seriously, and in fact, I have been looked down on for my intriguing thoughts simply

because I am female. This can further be seen when I am in the midst of creating innovative

projects. Men continuously undermine me, my work, and my work ethic, in an attempt to halt my

project or to discourage me that the idea will never work out. However, this never works and

although I get the job done, my efforts are dismissed or undervalued. Despite the challenges I go

through and overcome, I am inspired from female entrepreneurs like Reshma Saujani, and draw

inspiration from many others. In fact, I have taken courses at Girls Who Code, which has played

a transformative role in my tech journey. This dismissive behavior from men that I so

persistently receive fuels my determination to prove them wrong, and to one day create an

impact in the tech industry.

As the tech industry continues to rise, there needs to be a rise of female entrepreneurs. By

addressing these issues we can bring unique perspectives and to evidently promote diversity.

Female entrepreneurs can then drive innovation to create inclusive new technologies and to then

create economic growth within society as a whole. However, to achieve such goals will not be

easy. Female entrepreneurs have the power to drive great and meaningful change and to overall

break down gender barriers. Their unique perspectives can create a more meaningful change to

the tech industry as a whole. As a young woman aspiring to become a tech entrepreneur, I am

fully determined and motivated to leverage my skills, experiences, and knowledge to inspire

other women and to foolheartedly create a more diverse environment.
