# Textboost

A bionic reading tool that leverages the power of machine learning to enhance the reading experience and organization, particularly for individuals with an inability to focus.

## How TextBoost Harnesses Machine Learning

- **Folder Management**: The model can create subsections such as `modified/food`, `modified/space`, `modified/politics`, and more and store the respected pdf within their folder.
- **Text Summarization**: Textboost provides the capability to summarize the text within a given PDF. Optionally, the user can turn on this feature and the summarization will appear at the last page of the PDF.

> **PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING**<br/>
> Please note that this tool supports **simple text** extraction from PDFs. Complex elements like tables and code blocks will not be rendered properly.<br/>
> The updated PDF will be automatically placed in appropriate folders based on the text context. You can find your modified file in a folder similar to `./modified/space/your_file.py`.<br/>
> Don't forget to check your current directory for the outputted file.
