## About Textboost

TextBoost is an innovative tool that leverages the power of AI and machine learning to enhance the reading experience, particularly for individuals with ADHD. By incorporating customized bold formatting into text, TextBoost assists users in swiftly identifying crucial letters within words, making the text more accessible and captivating. With TextBoost, users can easily process text files or web content, generating modified files that retain the original content with the added bold formatting. By making reading more accessible and tailored to the needs of individuals with ADHD, TextBoost aims to contribute to a more inclusive and engaging reading experience.

## How TextBoost Harnesses Machine Learning

Powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, TextBoost offers additional data science-driven features that further enrich the user experience:

- **Language Translation (Optional Feature)**: By utilizing machine learning techniques, TextBoost can translate text to other languages. Users have the option to enable this feature, allowing them to read content in their preferred language.

- **Folder Management within "Downloads"**: TextBoost provides the capability to organize files within the "Downloads" directory. The model can create subsections such as `Downloads/food`, `Downloads/makeup`, `Downloads/clothing`, and more and store the respected pdf within their folder. Leveraging context-awareness, the machine learning algorithm in TextBoost automatically categorizes the outputted PDFs into their respective folders based on the content of the documents.
