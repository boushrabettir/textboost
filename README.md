## About Textboost

TextBoost is a bionic reading tool that leverages the power of machine learning to enhance the reading experience and organization, particularly for individuals with an inability to focus.

## How TextBoost Harnesses Machine Learning

Powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, TextBoost offers additional data science-driven features that further enrich the user experience:

- **Folder Management**: The model can create subsections such as `modified/food`, `modified/space`, `modified/politics`, and more and store the respected pdf within their folder.
- **Text Summarization**: Textboost provides the capability to summarize the text within a given PDF. Optionally, the user can turn on this feature and the summarization will appear at the last page of the PDF.

## Usage

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Git clone this repository by running the command `https://github.com/boushrabettir/textboost.git`
- Move to the `textboost` directory by running `cd ./textboost`
- Pip install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Convert your PDF to a Markdown using [this tool](https://products.groupdocs.app/conversion/pdf-to-md).
- Place your modified Markdown file in the `pre-modified` folder.
- Run the script by typing `python ./main.py`
- Navigate to the help menu to get started

> **PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING**<br/>
> Due to how PDF's are extracted, this tool only supports simple text. Therefore, tables, c>ode blocks, and other complicated aspects will not be rendered in properly.<br/
> The updated PDF will be automatically placed in their respective folders dependent on the context of the text. The model will place your file in a folder similar to `./modified/space/your_file.py`.<br/>
> Make sure to take a look in the current directory you are in to find your outputted file.

## Key Features

- Selective bold formatting to emphasize specific letters within words.
- Customization options to adjust the level of bold formatting.
